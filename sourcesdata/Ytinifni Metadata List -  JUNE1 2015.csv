How far would you go to save the one you Love?  Walter (JOHN HEARD – Big, Home Alone), a middle-aged man, down on his luck with no money, feels his back is against a wall with few options when his wife, Rose (CINDY WILLIAMS – American Graffiti, Laverne & Shirley), develops throat cancer. Without adequate funds for medical treatments - too poor for health insurance, too young for Medicare and too “rich” for Medicaid- Walter resorts to drastic measures and decides to rob a bank.  Walter steadily prepares for the big heist as he goes through his checklist for the bank robbery - getaway car, masks, guns – and casing the bank with an unfortunate run-in with the Bank Manager (BRUCE DAVISON – X-Men). When he and Rose get fired from their only house cleaning client (HELENE CARDONA - Chocolat) - Rose decides to become Walter’s partner and ""wingman"" in the bank robbery.  Walter’s son, Johnny (MARK FAMIGLIETTI – Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines), a cop, moves back in with Walter and Rose to keep an eye on his suspicious father. The strained father-son relationship gets tested and reevaluated by Johnny as he struggles to come to terms with his father’s determination and as he learns his own lessons in love when he falls for SALLY (JOSIE DAVIS – Dirty Teacher, Charles in Charge). When Rose turns out to be too ill to partake in the robbery – Walter enlists his eccentric friends (AL SAPIENZA – Sopranos, House of Cards, JUDE CICCOLLELA - 24, VIC POLIZOS – Prizzi’s Honor and JAMES GLEASON- American Dreamz) to help. Walter, Rose and Johnny all struggle in down-to-earth and comical ways as they all come to their own conclusions on what the final decision needs to be in their difficult situation.

Taking place in a cavernous east London church, this is a stark two handed confrontation between the gentle-spirited Reverend John and the Fighter of the title - a loquacious ball of anger and despair who breaks in from the street. Though the rhythmic back and forth of their exchange often smacks of the stage, there’s an impressive visual sheen here - and the dialogue is given a weighty intensity by the superb performances of Peter Cadwell and Clive Russell.""

Whilst there they discover a tiny village, which has been isolated from surrounding towns and in which the locals have developed their own way of life. The villagers are initially hostile towards the new family, but grow to accept them. Local priest Michael Howdy, however, takes an unhealthy interest in Mary's daughter Alice. Villagers Harry Price, John Elliot and Tom Hopkins, notice this interest and keep a close watch on Michael. After being involved in a car crash some years back, Michael has suffered head and brain injuries which spark off a series of surreal fantasies confusing Alice with his dead wife Isobel (who died in the car crash.) Whether or not Alice is connected with Isobel or that she merely has a resemblance to her is left deliberately ambiguous. Michaels illness invades his mind and his sanity leading to him finding himself in position he could never have intended.

Original self funded UK Thriller, First time feature for writers Richard Miller and Lee Price, A story never told before about a charachter with aspergers struggling to cope with rejection.

Review by Olivia James

A definite twist on the classic love story, what starts out as a cute encounter at a 
‘people skills course’ soon takes a downward spiral into something far more sinister. 
Neville Rumble is a wanton character who seems deeply disturbed and, above all else, 
lonely. A sad soul, who embodies a childlike petulance and, at times, an (uncomfortably) 
endearing innocence, depicted wonderfully by the film’s lead actor Ian Hencher. The 
film’s creators Lee Price and Richard Miller have accomplished a well-executed feature 
that continually builds suspense and tension with the viewer peering past door frames 
or over shoulders to view the scene before them. Staying close to Neville, his upper 
body is rarely in less than the full frame which immerses the viewer even more into the 
story as well as into his claustrophobia and isolation. A smooth editing pace coupled 
with a great soundtrack provided by independent musicians adds to Neville’s world and 
builds atmosphere around him. Made with a tiny crew and fantastic, at times beautiful, 
use of locations local to Warwickshire and the surrounding area, ‘Neville Rumble’ is a 
great achievement that will have the viewer constantly hooked for what’s coming next. 
If Neville’s love interest, Lucy, can keep her cool and her sanity remains to be seen";"-Create media kit for movie -have cast/crew do radio interviews -Send out early release copies to major publications like LA Times, LA Weekly, etc to get reviews of movies published -Will book cast/crew for shows like ""Good Day LA"" for live interviews.

Over the next 11 years, Michael would see over 70 different placements. Several times he ran away - life on the streets was more to his liking.

So at 13 when a friend took her to meet some homeless kids living under a bridge in town, Jacklyn knew she had found a new life. She would spend the next eight years on the streets. Jackson had a more traditional home life. But early exposure to drugs in his teen years resulted in Jackson choosing homelessness upon graduating high school.

using the most effective aggression and effective technique will win the round.
Also the three knock-down rule applies, and a fighter can only be saved from a
count by the bell in the final round. the choice to use MMA gloves or standard
kickboxing gloves are agreed to by both fighters. Because of the pace of the
action, if fighters get into a clinch they will be allowed a single knee strike
and then must break clean. If the referee says ‘break’ they must not hit on the
break. Rules are set so that certain things that are allowed in MMA are not
used in the UK1 bouts, such as standing/clinching elbow strikes, ground
fighting (grappling or striking), trips, takedowns or throws.



Since its first bouts, it has gained popularity, as it
makes their fight card more exciting and keeps the audience entertained if the
prior fights were boring due to slow pace striking or grappling. It also allows
the company to reach the type of audience that dislikes the use of small 6oz
MMA gloves, grappling and striking to a grounded opponent. There are also
titles in each weight division, which follows the same as their MMA divisions…";HD;16M ;Steve Baily,;Dave O'Donnell;Alex Davenport;Steve Baily;Spanish Fly;Super Striker LTD;PG13

For rookie Homicide Detective Chris Malloy this grisly scene is more than he expected to see in his first week of working the graveyard shift.

A Dark Comedy on a Serious, Timely Topic

Dave was middle management at a large investment firm in Las Vegas. He had a beautiful wife, a nice house, and a good life. When his company downsized him, he lost everything: his money, his home, his car...  Even his wife left him. 

Dave was about to commit suicide when his friend, Steve, a sometimes entrepreneur, has an idea: why not use crowdfunding to raise the money to save his house and get back on his feet.  Raise $100,000 and he’ll live. Otherwise, he'll kill himself at the final event -- the Suicide Party. 

The idea becomes even more wacky, but gains traction, when Steve introduces Dave to Gidget, a girl with a webcam and sexy online presence, to be their social media guru. 

Soon Dave's #SaveDave campaign goes viral with videos like Dave being maced while the repo guy takes his car, and Dave, Steve, and Gidget soon become local celebrities. 
Soon Dave is on The Late Show with Keith O'Brien where he's torn up like any other white trash celebrity.  But Dave's popularity only grows. 

However, the big problem is that as the deadline for the party approaches, Dave sees his following growing but not his bank account.  Yet Dave has suddenly found a new reason to live due to the excitement of his campaign and the support of his friends: Steve and Gidget. Unfortunately, almost everyone else is planning to go to the party not to support him, but because they're curious to see if he'll actually kill himself.

As the Suicide Party approaches, Dave becomes more and more panicky, as he feels the deadline to end the crowdfunding campaign approaching with only a small amount of the goal reached.  

So what will Dave do?  Will the party go forward?  Can he get the additional money he needs at the last minute?  Will he actually kill himself?  Or something else?
